# Superheroes API (NestJS)

This is a simple backend API built with NestJS to manage superheroes. It allows adding superheroes and fetching a list of superheroes sorted by their humility scores.

## Features:
- **POST /superheroes**: Add a new superhero with a name, superpower, and humility score (0 - 10).
- **GET /superheroes**: Fetch all superheroes sorted by their humility score (descending).


## Team Player Attitude
Collaboration is critical for developing effective products. If I were to work with a coworker on the subject, I would prioritize:

- **Clear Communication**: Ensuring that we discuss milestones and issues on a regular basis, as well as setting clear expectations and goals.
- **Pair Programming**   : Use pair programming to solve issues and share knowledge.
- **Code Reviews**       : Actively participating in code reviews and providing constructive criticism, while remaining open to recommendations from others.
- **Task Delegation**    : Dividing the task into smaller modules and assigning different aspects of the system to specific team members


## If I had more time

If I had more time, I would focus on the following areas:

- **Database Integration**: Currently, the application utilizes an array as a simple in-memory database. Integrating a persistent database, such as PostgreSQL or MongoDB, would enhance scalability and practical applications.
- **Unit Testing**:  I would like to expand the test coverage to include more situations, particularly edge cases (e.g., invalid inputs, database failures), to verify the application's robustness.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Adding authentication for users and role-based access control would result in a more secure and scalable application, especially in instances where specific actions must be controlled.
